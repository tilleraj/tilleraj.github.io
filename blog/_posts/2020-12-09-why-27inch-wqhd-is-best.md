title: Why a 27" 1440p Monitor is the Best Choice for YOU
sitemap: false
---

When shopping for new technology, especially computer monitors, it can be easy to get overwhelmed by all the numbers being thrown around. That's why I'm going to make an over-generalized statement and just tell you what to buy:

The **correct** choice is a 27" 2560x1440 monitor.

# Why is 27" 1440p monitor best monitor?
It just is. The rest of this post isn't actually helpful for the average shopper, it's just to argue with people on the internet. Go down to your local Best Buy and just pick up [whatever 27" QHD/1440p IPS monitor they have in-stock, maybe it's this one?](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lenovo-q27q-10-27-ips-led-qhd-freesync-monitor-displayport-hdmi-black/6404031.p?skuId=6404031). You'll be happy and save yourself a lot of headache trying to navigate all the options.

If you're a gamer, tack on FreeSync/GSync, 75Hz+ (144Hz seems to be popular), and maybe go check [/r/buildapcsales](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/). You don't get a link to a specific model, that stuff changes all the time and you knew what you were signing up for when you started PC gaming.
## Use Case: Normal people
[OSHA says](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/computerworkstations/components_monitors.html) to sit "20 to 40 inches" away from your monitor.

[The Mayo Clinic says](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/office-ergonomics/art-20046169) "about an arm's length away".

This comes out to 28" on average according to [some industrial design firm](http://macoshdesign.com/en/theory/articles/anthropometrical)(they're the only source I could find, okay?). Let's call it 30".

If we look at how pixel-dense monitors have been [over the past 20 years](#could-you-provide-reference-to-some-more-historical-monitors), it becomes apparent that 90+ PPI is typical. Apple's Retina display 'standard' is 
> "about 300 PPI for a device held 10 to 12 inches from the eye" - Steve Jobs.
{:.lead}
As it turns out, there's a better unit than PPI to use for measuring this.
### Pixels per Degree
I ripped this from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina_display#Rationale), but you can express Jobs' declaration like this:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  2dr\tan(5°) = PPD
  \\
  2 \cdot 10\scriptsize in \normalsize \cdot 300\scriptsize px/in \normalsize \cdot\ tan(5°) = 52.4 \scriptsize px/°
\end{aligned}
$$

So if we take that formula and solve for PPI instead, using our 30" from earlier, we get

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \frac{52.4 \scriptsize px/°}{2\cdot 30\scriptsize in \normalsize \tan(5°)} = 100\scriptsize px/in
\end{aligned}
$$

So straight from the Apple's mouth, we're looking to hit ~100px/in for desktop monitors.  
It should be noted, this is a target, but also a minimum. Think of it like the Price is Right, but backwards. We want to get close to it without going under.

### What does this magical 52.4 px/° look like?
#### I want to try to see the pixels
Do you have a 13" or 15" MacBook Pro made in the past eight years?  
Sit with your eyes 13.25" away from it.

13" Windows laptop? 
17.75" away

15" Windows Laptop? 
20.5" away

#### I want to see how small my text is
Do you have a 13" or 15" MacBook Pro made in the past eight years?  
Sit with your eyes 26.5" away from it.

13" Windows laptop? 
Same distance (assuming the recommended 150% scaling)

15" Windows Laptop?  
An inch closer with scaling at 125%

### Could you provide reference to some more... historical monitors?
uhh... sure. I've thrown in some more sizes of 1080p and 1440p monitors for good measure.

|WQHD |2560     |1440     |16:9 |29       |101.28 |

### So, what display do you daily drive?
Oh, thanks for asking!  
It's a Dell U2515H, 25" @ 1440p, so 117.5 PPI  
This puts it in the ballpark of the ~113 PPI found in 2012 and later Macbook Pros (13" or 15") with their 200% scaling, or a 13" 1920x1080 Windows laptop with 150% scaling. The minimum ideal viewing distance for Steve Jobs' eye balls and my screen would be ~25.5".
I sit 28" away so I'm experiencing 57.4px/° as I write this. This is "smaller" than most people would like or are used to. Going up to a 27" display takes care of that.

### Why a 27" and not a 29"?
If you had a 29" 1440p display, sitting any closer than 29$$\scriptsize \frac{3}{4}$$" would dip you below the mythical 52.4 px/°.
If you 'downgrade' to a 27" though, you can sit 2" closer at 27$$\scriptsize \frac{3}{4}$$". Hey, that's almost exactly our average arm's length from before!

"But I have bad eyes and things are always too small for me on my screen!"  
Fine, YOU can get the 29" display.

## Use Case: 'Enthusiasts'
"What if I'm a gamer? Don't I want 4K?"  
Just don't do it, kids.

### Scaling is bad, mmkay?
- It can make things blurry for no reason
- You're throwing money out the window by not running your monitor at native resolution

### I don't care about scaling, I'm a #gamer and want to do #gaming at 4k!
See my [upcoming post about why 4k gaming is silly](#), but the tl;dr is that in order to get just 30fps at 4K, your rig will have to be capable of 1080p/120fps. With those same resources you could game on Super Ultra Wide 1080p/60fps.

For what it would take to play 4K/60fps, you could instead be playing Ultra Wide 1440p/100fps (or 3x1080p/75+fps if that's your thing)

The point is, you'll either have to deal with scaling and running your games at resolutions lower than 4K, or if you somehow have a machine capable of playing games at 4K, there are better ways of utilizing it.

## Notes from the Author
Oh hey, wow, you read the whole thing. If you made it this far, you probably have some questions or accusations. Let's see if I saw them coming...
- What about TN and VA panels?
  - They're bad and you should feel bad /s. In all seriousness, is there a valid use case for them and/or can they be a good way to save a buck? Sure. But they can also be GARBAGE. Most people are better served by better viewing angles and color accuracy than faster grey to gray times or whatever. Also they make some pretty quick IPS panels these days!
- Isn't your whole argument precariously balanced on how much the reader values one Steve Jobs' quote?
  - It was convenient and he agreed with me. Fight me. 
  - Also this was all inspired by me being tired of explaining all of the above over and over again when it turns out a lot of people just want to be told what to buy.
